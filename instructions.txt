# Put instructions for your CannedPostResponder in here.
# Instructions consist of:
#   1) a Python regex
#   2) optional flags for the python regex engine
#   3) the name of a text file
# CannedPostResponder will respond to posts found matching
# the regex with the contents of the named file.
# Regexes will be matched against a string consisting of:
#  1) the submission's subreddit name
#  2) the submission's title
#  3) the submission's body
# These three will be separated by newlines, allowing
# you create regexes that match only in subreddit names,
# titles or bodies, if you want.
# Comments are allowed.
