CannedPostResponder
by Charlie Pashayan

INTRODUCTION

CannedPostResponder is a piece of software that connects to Reddit, scans the
newest posts in selected subreddits, and posts a specified response whenever a
post matching a specified regular expression is found.  The user interacts with
CannedPostResponder via a script called cpr_admin.py.  This script is also used
to manage the settings and instructions for CannedPostResponder.

I wrote this software on a Macbook Pro running OS X 10.7 using Python 2.7.  It
should run on other *nix systems, but I can think of at least one reason why it
would fail under Windows.

INSTALLATION

You don't need to do much to install CannedPostResponder, but I've included a
script called install_cpr.py to make it easier to set up.  install_cpr.py scans
your installed modules to make sure you have everything that
CannedPostResponder needs to run.  If anything is missing, you can install it
using pip or easy_install.  

Then, if everything is in order, install_cpr.py will create a script allowing
you to call cpr_admin.py from anywhere on your system, so that you don't need
to be in CannedPostResponder's home directory to invoke it.  By default, this
script will be called cpr_admin and it will be stored in the current directory,
but you can call it whatever you want by providing the desired name to
install_cpr.py as a positional artument.

SETTINGS

        username
        This is the username you want CannedPostResponder to log in as  and
post under.

        password
        The password for the username above.  Passwords are not encrypted.

        proprietor
        This should be your name or main Reddit account.  It is included in the
user_agent that CannedPostResponder submits when connecting to Reddit.

        subreddits
        This is a list of subreddits that CannedPostResponder will look through
when searching for relevant posts.  Add items to it using the --add_subreddits
flag; remove items using the --del_subreddits flag.  

        limit
        The maximum number of submissions that CannedPostResponder will pull
when checking a subreddit for the first time.  (After that it will just pull
all the submissions it hasn't seen yet.)  The largest number of submissions
that can be pulled in one request is 99.  Larger pulls will take considerably
longer because Reddit only allows an average of one request every 2 seconds.

        sleep_time
        After CannedPostResponder has scanned all the subreddits, This setting
tells it how many seconds to wait before checking for more new submissions. 
You'll probably want to make this pretty big; 3600 (an hour) or even 86400 (a
day) would be reasonable places to start.

        email
        The email address that CannedPostResponder will send email reports
from.  Leave it blank if you don't want it to generate these reports.

        email_password
        The password for CannedPostResponder's email address.  Passwords are
not encrypted.

        recipients
        This is a list of email addresses you want CannedPostResponder to send
reports to.  Add items to it using the --add_recipients flag; remove items
using the --del_recipients flag.

        smtp_server
        The email server that CannedPostResponder will use for sending out
reports from.  I know that my email routines work for GMail.  I can't speak for
any other service.  So use smtp.gmail.com if at all possible.

        smtp_port
        The port on the email server above that CannedPostResponder will
connect to.  Should be 465.

        text_editor
        When you edit the instructions file or create messages, cpr_admin.py
will open the files for you in the text editor you specify here.  I use emacs.

        log_reader
        CannedPostResponder generates a log file which you view by running
cpr_admin.py with the --log flag enabled.  This setting tells cpr_admin.py what
program to use to open the file.

FLAGS

Unless otherwise mentioned, all the settings above are managed by invoking
cpr_admin.py with the setting's name as a flag (that is, prepended with "--")
followed by the value you want the setting to hold.  For instance, if you want
to set sleep_time to 6000 and the proprietor to Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo, type
the following command:

        $ cpr_admin.py --sleep_time 6000 --proprietor "Joey Joe Joe Jr.
Shabdoo"
        
Obviously flags of this type only work for settings that contain exactly one
value.  For lists (subreddits and recipients), you need separate flags for
adding and subtracting values.  So the flag to add to a list has the form
--add_<list name> and the flag to remove form a list looks like --del_<list
name>.  So to add learnpython to the list of subreddits and to remove
FakeNameMcHenry@example.com and contrived@example.com from the list of
recipients, type the following command:

        $ cpr_admin.py --add_subreddit learnpython --del_recipients
FakeNameMcHenry@example.com contrived@example.com

In any case, whatever setting is changed, cpr_admin.py will show you the new
value after making the change (unless invoked with the --silent command).  If
you run cpr_admin.py with no flags, it will simply dump all the settings.  No
attempt is made to encrypt or hide passwords, by the way.  So make sure they
aren't important ones.

In addition to managing settings, cpr_admin.py is the interface for the
CannedPostResponder.  So most of the other flags deal with that.

        --run
        Run an instance of CannedPostResponder.  Only one CannedPostResponder
can run at a time on a given system, so if one already exists, cpr_admin.py
will report the error and exit.

        --suspend
        Suspend the currently running instance of CannedPostResponder.

        --resume
        Resume the currently suspended running instance of CannedPostResponder.

        --kill
        Kill the currently running instance of CannedPostResponder.

        --log
        Ths flag opens the log file generated by all previous instances of
CannedPostResponder.

There are also flags for managing the text files that CannedPostResponder needs
in order to run:

        --instructions
        Edit the list of instructions for CannedPostResponder.  The standard
for this list will described below.

        --message <file name>
        Open the file by the given name for editing.  Use this command to
create CannedPostResponder's canned responses.

The flags --silent, --help and --version do what you'd expect, except for the
fact that cpr_admin.py considers itself to be part of CannedPostResponder, and
when asked for its version it will respond accordingly. 

INSTRUCTIONS

The instructions file is one of the most delicate parts of CannedPostResponder.
It's also the program's most powerful hook.  You will need to know how to write
regular expressions in Python in order to write instructions for
CannedPostResponder.  Here's a link to the documentation on this:

        http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html

Once you're convinced you understand that well enough, you can start telling
CannedPostResponder what to do.  Each instruction for CannedPostResponder
consists of one (logical) line of text containing:

        1) A Python-ready regular expression;
        2) Optionally, flags for the regex engine--if there are more than one
of these they must be bitwise OR'd;
        3) The name of a text file containing the response you want
CannedPostResponder to post when it finds a submission matching the regular
expression.

If you wish, you may separate these three elemenets with commas.  Think of the
first two items in this list as options to re.compile().  Write them exactly as
you would if you were writing code using that function.  Here's an example:

        r"matt\s+gr(ee|oa)ning", re.I, "pronunciation_guide.txt"

The strings representing the regular expression and the file name can be
printed in any way allowed within Python source code, because they will be read
in with Python's standard tokenizer.  An individual string can be printed out
across multiple physical lines, as long as all the substrings are enclosed
within parentheses.  This will make it a little easier to write long,
complicated regular expressions.  You may also insert comments or comment out
instructions using the "#".  Here's an example:

        ("here's a (picture of|drawing by) my " 
         # find obvious, annoying karma seekers
         "((autistic|blind|disabled|overweight|tall|funny|sexy)(,\s*)?)+ " 
         # match a list of possible ailments and descriptors
         "(sister|brother|cousin|niece|nephew|daughter|son)"), 
         # establishe relationship to poster
        re.I, "please_stop_doing_this.txt" 
        # express your prefab discontent with this all too typical post

The regular expression you provide will be matched against a string consisting
of the following:

        1) The subreddit the post was found on;
        2) The title of the post;
        3) The body of the post.

These three will be joined by newlines.  The body may contain newlines as well,
but the first two newlines encountered are guaranteed to mark the boundaries
between items 1 and 2 of the list above.  Your regular expression can match any
position within this string, unless of course you set the string beginning and
end boundaries explicitly.

One final note is that the regular expressions in the instructions file will be
matched against each post sequentially, and the file associated with the first
successful match will be posted.  So in a case where multiple regular
expressions might match the same post, the order the instructions are placed in
will matter.  For example, here is a badly written instructions file:

        u"i love m(ue|ü)sli", re.I, "i_agree.txt"
        u"dammit, i love m(ue|ü)sli", re.I, "i_agree_like_hell.txt"

The problem is that the second instruction is redundant and can never be run,
because anything that will be caught by the second expression is guaranteed to
be caught by the first.
